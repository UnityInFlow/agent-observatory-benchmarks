# The review hook's own tests. `git`, `jq` and `opencode` are stubbed — no network, no

#
# WHY THE NEGATIVE CASES MATTER MORE THAN THE POSITIVE ONES
#
# A hook that fires on everything gets muted within a week, and a muted hook is worse than
# no hook because the repository still looks reviewed. So the cases asserting the reviewer
# was NOT called carry as much weight here as the ones asserting it was.
#
# The stub records every invocation to $CALLS, so "did it fire" and "what did it pass" are
# both assertable without a model.
